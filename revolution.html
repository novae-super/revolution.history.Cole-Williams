        <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">African Americans</h2>
        <p>Even though African Americans were disregarded, and called savages across the colonies, they played a massive role
            in how the war turned out. Take for example, Crispus Attucks, a Martyr, was originally a slave, but then escaped and got his
            unearned freedom, and then went to become a whale hunter, along with his white friends. He was the first American
            killed in the revolution. Another African American who had a significant impact on the war, was Peter Salem. Peter
            Salem was essential in the revolution, as he killed one of the highest ranked officers during the battle of Bunker Hill.
            He was rewarded and praised for his sharp shot. Probably one of the most important African Americans in the entire war is
            James Amistad Lafayette. He was a double agent, but a spy for the Americans against the British, and gave the Americans
            vital info they needed in order to win the battle of York Town.
